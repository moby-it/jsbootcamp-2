# TODO app

A simple todo app written in vanilla JavaScript

## Requirements

For a visual representation, see https://todo.mobyplaygrounds.com/. You need to make an exact copy of the website. Here are some that points that might not be obvious:

- Use the same background color, spacings, fonts.
- The input element should create a card not only via the button but also via pressing 'Enter'.
- Icons used are imported as SVG files from https://iconoir.com/.
- There should be a message displayed if no notes present.
- For each note you should be able to 
  1. mark as done (strikethrough the text)
  2. delete (remove from the list)
